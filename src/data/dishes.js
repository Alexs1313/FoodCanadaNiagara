  In a medium saucepan, bring maple syrup to a boil over medium-high heat.

  Boil without stirring until it reaches 235°F (113°C) on a candy thermometer — the "soft ball" stage. (Careful, it can bubble up fast!)

  3. Pour the Syrup:
  Remove syrup from heat immediately.

  Carefully pour the hot syrup in thin lines over the snow.

  4. Roll the Taffy:
  Wait a few seconds for the syrup to firm slightly (it should still be soft and sticky).

  Press a popsicle stick onto the syrup strip and gently roll it up into a taffy lollipop!`,
