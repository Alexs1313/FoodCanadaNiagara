    ingredients: [
      `1 ½ cups all-purpose flour`,
      `2 tablespoons sugar`,
      `1 tablespoon baking powder`,
      `½ teaspoon salt`,
      `1 ¼ cups milk`,
      `1 egg`,
      `3 tablespoons melted butter (plus extra for the pan)`,
      `1 teaspoon vanilla extract`,
      `¼ cup pure maple syrup (plus more for serving)`,

    receipt: `Mix Dry Ingredients
In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.

Combine Wet Ingredients
In another bowl, beat the egg with milk, melted butter, vanilla, and maple syrup until smooth.

Make the Batter
Pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients. Stir gently just until combined — a few lumps are okay.

Preheat the Pan
Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease with butter.

Cook the Pancakes
Pour about ¼ cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake. Cook until bubbles form on the surface and the edges start to look set (about 2–3 minutes), then flip and cook another 1–2 minutes until golden brown.

Serve Warm
Stack the pancakes and serve with a generous drizzle of warm maple syrup and a pat of butter. Optional: top with fresh berries or whipped cream.`,
